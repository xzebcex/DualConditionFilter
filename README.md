# **DualConditionFilter PGSQL Query**
This SQL query retrieves all columns (or a subset of columns) from the "students" table where the "student id" is 10234 and the "class id" equals 'SQL101'.
## Usage
To use this query, you may modify the "SELECT" statement to include the specific columns you want to retrieve from the "students" table. The "WHERE" clause specifies the conditions that the selected rows must meet, in this case filtering by the student ID and class ID. You may modify the values in the "WHERE" clause to retrieve data for a different student or class.

## Notes
If you only need specific columns from the "students" table, it is recommended to specify those columns in the "SELECT" statement instead of using the wildcard "*".
The query name "DualConditionFilter" refers to the use of the "AND" operator in the "WHERE" clause to filter data based on two criteria.
